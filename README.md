# fractal
An Ethereum dApp built with truffle that provides a simple interface to donate to a collective, and fair distribution of those donations amongst designated addresses.

# caution
This dApp is being built by someone who has a tenuous grasp on Solidity security at best.  The author is using this as a method of self-teaching, and is not 
responsible for any lost Eth or unattended side effects!  I do not plan to deploy or use this on mainnet.  

# todo
*  create donation pool
*  add basic data types
*  implement simple consensus voting algorithm  and data structures
*  validations/input security
*  test cases
